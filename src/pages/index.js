              Cleaning, fashion and sustainability go hand in hand. We make it
              our mission to offer luxury retail boutiques a unique cleaning
              experience to what is currently available in the marketplace. With
              a major focus on customer service and retail excellence, we
              believe in delivering exceptional results to a demographic that
              expects nothing but the best. We are truly committed to
              redesigning standards, delivering the concept of sustainability
              and premium cleaning services to the retail industry. Here at
              Sustainable Cleaning we simply want to do less damage to the
              environment. We offer quality and environmentally safe products
              that are good for you, your employees, your customers and our
              planet. We carefully select plant based ecological cleaners and
              supplies that ensure safety and top performance. It’s more than
              just swapping out cleaning chemicals.

                The concept of sustainability is composed of three pillars:
                people, planet, and product. Sourcing the right cleaning product
                with the right materials and standards takes a lot of
                dedication, meticulous attention to detail and research. It’s
                our promise to find industry professionals and suppliers that
                share the same values and goals as we do: respect for employees,
                limiting environmental impact, long-term vision of
                sustainability, committed to social change, ethical mindset.
